Series of tutorial code snippets for use
#Maven publish tutorial steps
Publishing artifact to Nexus snapshot and release repo using maven.

1. Create a snapshot repo using nexus, or use default coming in out of the box. DEFAULT 
2. Create a release repo using nexus, or use default coming out of the box. DEFAULT
3. Create a group repo having both release, snapshot and other third party repos. or use default coming out of the box.
4. Download spring initializer project
5. Go settings.xml under <MAVEN_INSTALL_LOCATION>\apache-maven-3.6.0\conf or C:\Users\<USER_NAME>\.m2  or mkdir ~/.m2

10. Run the following `maven`/`mvn` commands to validate/package/deploy your app artifacts remotely
   - `mvn validate`   (validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available.)
   - `mvn compile`    (compile the source code of the project)
   - `mvn test`       (run tests using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed.)
   - `mvn package`    (take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a WAR/JAR/EAR.)
   - `mvn verify`     (run any checks to verify the package is valid and meets quality criteria.)
   - `mvn install`    (install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally.)
   - `mvn deploy`     (done in an integration or release environment, copies the final package to the remote/SNAPSHOT repository 
                      for sharing with other developers and projects.)

11. Change the version from 1.0-Snapshot to 1.0
12. Run `mvn deploy` to deploy to Snapshot Repo or `mvn clean deploy -P release`, to deploy it to Release Repo
